# How to Use check_chart_of_accounts, import_chart_of_accounts and replace_chart_of_accounts

Put the client's own chart of accounts on a company, so their opening balances and books use the accounts
they already know.

## When

The client has a chart of accounts of their own (an export from Tally, Zoho, QuickBooks, or a sheet) and the
company on this site has the standard one. Do this **before** the opening balances, so the trial balance
finds its accounts by the client's names and numbers.

## Steps

1. Open the file (`start_import_session`) and map its columns to Account fields with `set_column_mapping`
   (DocType Account): Account Name, Parent Account, and where the file has them Account Number, Root Type,
   Account Type, Is Group. A Tally export of groups and ledgers is one sheet with the group as the parent.
2. `check_chart_of_accounts(session, company)`. Show the tree's top levels, the counts, and what each
   account is proposed to be (root type, account type, and where that came from: the file's own column,
   Tally's primary groups, words in the name, or its parent).
   - `unclassified` lists **every** account no rule could place. Ask the user about all of them in one
     list, then pass the answers as `classifications` ({account name: {root_type, account_type}}).
   - `problems` lists a cycle, an account under a ledger, an account twice. Nothing can be imported until
     the file is corrected.
3. Say which modes the company allows (`modes`). **map** is the default when the company has transactions,
   **add** otherwise; **replace** is offered only for a company with no ledger entries and no submitted
   documents, and is refused with the reason otherwise.
4. Do what the user picks:
   - **map**: `import_chart_of_accounts(mode="map")`. The client's accounts that match the company's become
     those accounts; nothing is created. List what matched nothing (`unmatched`) and ask: add them
     (`add_unmatched`) or map them by hand.
   - **add**: `import_chart_of_accounts(mode="add")`. The accounts are created under the right parents,
     parents first. One the company has already is kept.
   - **replace**: tell the user it **deletes** the company's accounts and creates the client's, and how many
     of each (`replace_chart_of_accounts` without the figures gives them). Pass `accounts_removed` and
     `accounts_created` exactly. It is refused, with the list, while a tax template, item tax template,
     mode of payment or GST Settings points at the company's accounts: the user removes those, or picks add.
     Afterwards set the default accounts listed in `defaults_left_empty` (Company settings).
5. The client's account names and numbers are kept as old IDs under `source_system`, so the opening trial
   balance later resolves its accounts by them without asking.

## Rules

- Never guess an account's root type: an account the rules can't place is asked about.
- Never replace on a company with transactions, whatever the user says: map or add.
- A chart is not designed in chat: restructuring an existing one is an accountant's job.
